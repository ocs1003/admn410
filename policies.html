				<h4>Financing Policy</h4>
			</header>
			<p>
			Durham House of Pets offers financing for all of its services. 
			These services include cat and dog training, nail clipping, bathing, and grooming. 
			These services are available for single visits, but are also offered as a financed subscription. 
			Customers can purchase various annual memberships to include the specific services they wish to 
			get for their pet. Each membership can be paid in full or be broken into monthly payments in 
			order to spread out the costs. Buying an annual membership can save you hundreds each year and 
			breaking down the annual cost does not impact the overall total cost of the membership!
