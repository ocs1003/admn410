				<h4>History</h4>
			</header>
			<p>
			Started in 1970 by Jonathan Tate, Durham House of Pets has grown to become a widespread pet store
			 in the  United States. It has thrived off of its family-feel and helpful staff. Originally, 
			DHP sold only dog supplies, but has since grown to incorporate both cats and snakes. It was not 
			until 1984 that Tate decided to begin carrying cat supplies in his Durham location. The snake 
			section of the store came into play nearly 7 years later. In 2008, Jonathan Tate and his two 
			sons, Jackson and Garrett, decided to make their operation a large scale pet supply store rather 
			than a local one location shop. The Tates moved their headquarters to an office in Boston, and 
			began looking at locations to open other retail stores in. In 2011 the three men opened up two 
			additional locations: Charleston, SC, and Burlington, VT.
